# Authentic vue experiment

This is an experiment to show how one could go about implementing login in a
Vue app using authentic.

== Disclaimer ==
This is an experiment, and as such is not secure! Github has notified me of two
potential security flaws, hoek and ecstatic, hoek being used as part of
authentic-service in "scale-service", and ecstatic being used as part of wzdr
in scale-admin. If time permits, these will be rectified.

First stop is just the pure html implementation as shown on the blog: https://dry.ly/authentic

Next step is integrating with vue.js
